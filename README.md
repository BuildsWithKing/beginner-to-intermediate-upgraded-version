# Beginner-to-Intermediate Solidity Smart Contracts 🚀

Welcome to my personal Solidity mastery repository! This is a project-based learning journey that documents my transition from a Solidity beginner to intermediate (and beyond) using Foundry and professional smart contract development practices.


---

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains a growing collection of hands-on Solidity smart contract projects built to solidify my understanding of:

- Solidity syntax and best practices

- Foundry testing and deployment workflows

- Custom errors, events, and advanced access control patterns

- Secure ETH handling (receive, fallback, withdrawals)

- Writing clean, gas-optimized, and professional-grade smart contracts

---

### Each project is organized in its own folder with:

- A dedicated README explaining the project scope and goals.

- Full Foundry test suites with high coverage.

- Proper ETH flow management and access control.

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

### Milestone	Goal

- Step 1	Master basic Solidity (Structs, Mappings, Functions, Modifiers).
- Step 2	Implement gas-optimized custom errors and modifiers.
- Step 3	Build secure ETH handling with receive and fallback.
- Step 4	Practice Owner-only access control and event logging.
- Step 5	Master Foundry testing, coverage, and deployment scripts.
- Ongoing	Learn advanced patterns, design upgrades, and modular contracts.
